# Compresso

**Make images lighter.** A small image optimizer that runs entirely on your device —
nothing is uploaded, and it works with no connection at all.

Drop in a hundred photos, watch them get pressed in parallel, and take them back.
No account, no queue, no upload bar, no server. Install it and it keeps working on a
plane.

## Why this exists

Every image optimizer makes you pick two out of three:

|  | private | batch | free & install-free |
|---|---|---|---|
| TinyPNG, iLoveIMG, Kraken | ✗ uploads your files | ✓ | ✓ |
| Squoosh | ✓ | ✗ one at a time | ✓ |
| ImageOptim, Optimage, Compresto | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ Mac-only |
| **Compresso** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

Nothing occupied the intersection. This does.

## How it works

The compression core is [`compresso.js`](https://github.com/iziuqo/compresso) — a
~2.5 KB, zero-required-dependency library built on the browser's own codecs. The app
runs it inside a pool of Web Workers (`createImageBitmap` → `OffscreenCanvas` →
`convertToBlob`), sized from `navigator.hardwareConcurrency`, so a large batch never
touches the main thread and the interface stays at 60fps while it works.

A separate worker is held back for the live preview, so dragging the quality slider
during a 200-file batch answers immediately instead of queueing behind it. It is
counted *inside* the pool's ceiling — every busy worker can be holding a decoded
12 MP bitmap, and memory is the binding constraint, not cores.

- **Formats in:** JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF, GIF, BMP, **HEIC/HEIF** (iPhone photos)
- **Formats out:** AVIF, WebP, JPEG, PNG — `Auto` picks the best the browser can write
- **Never bigger:** lossy output is never larger than the source. PNG can't be
  quantised by a canvas, so keeping PNG can grow a file — the app says so, and offers
  the conversion that actually shrinks it.

## Offline

Everything is precached at install: the shell, the fonts, the icons, the compression
worker, and the HEIC decoder. That last one is ~3 MB, which is a deliberate trade —
HEIC is what an iPhone actually produces, and a decoder that needs the network is a
decoder that fails exactly when you promised it wouldn't. It downloads in the
background after first paint, so it never delays a cold start.

There is no runtime caching strategy for user content, because there is no user
content on the network. Offline isn't a degraded mode here; it's the normal one.

## Languages

English · Español · Français · Deutsch · Italiano · Português (BR) · 简体中文

Detected from the system, overridable at any time, stored locally. All seven ship in
the main bundle (~4 KB each) rather than lazily — switching language must not need a
network, or it would break offline.

Numbers are localised, not just translated: `Intl.NumberFormat` formats every byte
count and percentage, so a French UI reads `1,5 MB`. The Latin display face is scoped
by `unicode-range`; Chinese falls back to a system CJK stack, which costs zero bytes
and looks native.

## Design

"The Press" — Compresso → espresso → pressing. Paper, ink, pressure, impression.
Letterpress deboss instead of drop shadows, hairlines instead of boxes, one accent
used at most twice per screen, and a grain layer over everything.

Motion has four easing curves and none of them can overshoot: every control point
sits at y ≤ 1, so bounce is not representable in the system. There are no springs.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

```bash
npm run build     # typecheck + production build
npm run preview   # serve the build (needed to exercise the service worker)
npm run icons     # regenerate app icons from the mark
```

### The engine is vendored, for now

`src/engine/core/` is `compresso.js` v0.4.0 vendored as **source**, because v0.4.0 —
the release that adds the worker backend — is not yet published to npm. Once it is,
delete that directory, `npm i compresso.js@^0.4.0`, and repoint the two imports.
Nothing else changes; that's why it's vendored unmodified.
